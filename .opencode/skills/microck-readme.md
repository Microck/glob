# microck readme structure

use this skill to structure any README.md in the project. all text content must follow the `microck-writing` skill.

## layout template

1. **logo**: centered small image (`width="100"`) acting as the brand mark.
2. **description**: 1-sentence lowercase description immediately below the logo.
3. **badges**: minimal tech badges (license, node version, tech stack) in a centered paragraph.
4. **primary visual**: a large, high-resolution preview gif or screenshot (`width="800"`) centered below the badges.
5. **quickstart**: minimal steps to get it running.
6. **features**: bullet points explaining the *why* alongside the *what*.
7. **how it works**: a mermaid flowchart (optional, only for non-trivial logic) followed by a numbered list.
8. **usage/api**: minimal code blocks or json examples.
9. **project structure**: a simple tree or directory breakdown.
10. **license**: clear and direct.

## visual requirements

- **logo**: must be the first element.
- **main visual**: must be high resolution. if no visual exists, prompt the user to add one.
- **spacing**: use `---` separators between major sections.

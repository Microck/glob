# microck writing style

use this skill for all text-based communication, including documentation, code comments, and readme content.

## core principles

- **lowercase everything**: headers, descriptions, list items, and sentence starts. only capitalize specific brand names or technical acronyms (e.g., Next.js, MCP, GLB, MIT).
- **no ai slop**: strictly avoid: *crucial, pivotal, enhance, leverage, comprehensive, underscore, highlight, tapestry, foster, align, delve*.
- **human pacing**: mix short, blunt sentences with occasional longer ones. write like a senior engineer who is too busy for fluff.
- **concrete over abstract**: give practical examples. instead of "optimized performance," say "50MB models shouldn't take ten seconds to load."

## prohibitions

- no em dashes.
- no "in conclusion" or "overall."
- no "not only... but also."
- no moralizing or didactic phrases ("it is important to remember...").
- no meta-talk ("let's walk through...", "below is a detailed overview...").

## examples

### good

### bad
> this tool leverages cutting-edge algorithms to enhance the performance of your 3d assets, playing a pivotal role in the modern web ecosystem.

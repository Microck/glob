## Privacy policy

Revision from October 21, 2025.

[See full edit history on GitHub.](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-legal/commits/main/privacy.md)

### Definitions

- **Company**: imput LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of
Wyoming, in the United States.
- **Maintainers**: Representatives of the Company acting on its behalf, whose goal is to develop and
improve Helium and/or Services.
- **Helium**: The open-source browser developed primarily by the Maintainers. Its source code is
available in the following repositories: [helium](https://github.com/imputnet/helium), [helium-macos](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos), [helium-linux](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-linux) and/or [helium-windows](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-windows).
- **Services**: Network-based services developed primarily by the Maintainers and hosted exclusively
by the Company, whose source code is available in the [helium-services](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-services) repository.
- **Website**: The website (helium.computer) where this privacy policy is displayed.

### Privacy policy

Helium does not make any network requests, including to the Services, unless such requests are the
result of user actions (for example, visiting a website or installing an extension) or are part of
features that the user has explicitly enabled or configured during setup. If Helium is making any
network requests without your consent, please [file a bug report](https://github.com/imputnet/helium/issues).

All browsing data managed by Helium is stored locally on your device. You have full control over it
and can delete or modify it at any time. Neither the Company nor the Maintainers have access to this
data.

Services do not collect, store, or share any personal information. Certain non-identifiable
technical information (e.g., anonymized server logs) may be retained for no longer than 24 hours to
detect and prevent abuse or to improve the Services. We do not share this information with third
parties under any circumstances.

We use Cloudflare for content delivery and protection of our Website. For more information about
Cloudflare, refer to the [Third-party providers](https://helium.computer/privacy#third-party-providers) section.

Our Website may load a Plausible Analytics script hosted on a server owned and managed by the
Company. We use Plausible to collect anonymized traffic analytics. Our Plausible instance does not
store any identifying information about you. You can read more about Plausible [on their website](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

This privacy policy does not apply to third-party or unofficial builds of Helium or derivatives,
instances of the Services not operated by the Company, or non-production deployments of Services
used by Maintainers to develop and improve the Services.

### Miscellaneous legal disclaimers

This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, United States, without regard
to conflict of law principles. By using Helium or the Services, you consent to the processing of
information in the United States and/or the European Union, which may have data protection laws
different from those in your country. Since Helium, or the Services, generally do not collect
personal information, rights under GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws may not be applicable. However, if
you believe we hold any personal data about you, you may contact us to request access, correction,
or deletion. We will respond as required under applicable law.

Helium and the Services are not directed at children under 13 (or the minimum age in your
jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be
announced on our website, GitHub, or social media channels. Continued use of Helium or the Services
after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.

### Security

The Services currently run inside virtual machines with full-disk encryption. For communication with
the Services, Helium uses the TLS 1.3 protocol. While we take reasonable measures to protect the
Services and associated infrastructure, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100%
secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### Third-party providers

- **Cloudflare**: Used for the Website and for content delivery of software updates
(updates.helium.computer). Cloudflare does not process data from the Services. Use of Cloudflare
services is also subject to the [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).
- **GitHub**: Used for storing and collaborating around Helium sources, and used as the source of
truth for Helium releases. Use of GitHub is subject to the [GitHub General Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).
- **Stripe**: Used for processing tips, accessible via an external link on the [sponsor page](https://helium.computer/sponsor). Use of Stripe is subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy) and [Data Processing Agreement](https://stripe.com/legal/dpa).
- **Liberapay**: Used for processing tips, accessible via an external link on the [sponsor page](https://helium.computer/sponsor). Use of Liberapay is subject to their [Privacy Policy](https://liberapay.com/about/privacy).

If we engage additional providers that users may come into contact with, we will update this section
accordingly.

## about

### best way to save what you love

cobalt helps you save anything from your favorite websites: video, audio, photos or gifs. just paste the link and you’re ready to rock!

no ads, trackers, paywalls, or other nonsense. just a convenient web app that works anywhere, whenever you need it.

### motivation

cobalt was created for public benefit, to protect people from ads and malware pushed by alternative downloaders.
we believe that the best software is safe, open, and accessible. all imput project follow these basic principles.

### leading privacy & efficiency

all requests to the backend are anonymous and all information about potential file tunnels is encrypted.
we have a strict zero log policy and don’t store or track _anything_ about individual people.

if a request requires additional processing, such as remuxing or transcoding, cobalt processes media
directly on your device. this ensures best efficiency and privacy.

if your device doesn’t support local processing, then server-based live processing is used instead.
in this scenario, processed media is streamed directly to client, without ever being stored on server’s disk.

you can [enable forced tunneling](https://cobalt.tools/settings/privacy#tunnel) to boost privacy even further.
when enabled, cobalt will tunnel all downloaded files, not just those that require it.
no one will know where you download something from, even your network provider.
all they’ll see is that you’re using a cobalt instance.

### open community

cobalt is used by countless artists, educators, and content creators to do what they love.
we’re always on the line with our community and work together to make cobalt even more useful.
feel free to [join the conversation](https://cobalt.tools/about/community)!

we believe that the future of the internet is open, which is why cobalt is [source first](https://sourcefirst.com/) and [easily self-hostable](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/main/docs/run-an-instance.md).

if your friend hosts a processing instance, just ask them for a domain and [add it in instance settings](https://cobalt.tools/settings/instances#community).

you can check the source code and contribute [on github](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt) at any time.
we welcome all contributions and suggestions!

## Cobalt — About / Privacy policy

Source: https://cobalt.tools/about/privacy


??

## about

### general terms

cobalt’s privacy policy is simple: we don’t collect or store anything about you.
what you do is solely your business, not ours or anyone else’s.

these terms are applicable only when using the official cobalt instance.
in other cases, you may need to contact the instance hoster for accurate info.

### local processing

tools that use on-device processing work offline, locally,
and never send any processed data anywhere.
they are explicitly marked as such whenever applicable.

### saving

when using saving functionality, cobalt may need to proxy or remux/transcode files.
if that’s the case, then a temporary tunnel is created for this purpose
and minimal required information about the media is stored for 90 seconds.

on an unmodified & official cobalt instance, **all tunnel data is encrypted with a key that only the end user has access to**.

encrypted tunnel data may include:

- origin service’s name.
- original URLs for media files.
- internal arguments needed to differentiate between types of processing.
- minimal file metadata (generated filename, title, author, creation year, copyright info).
- minimal information about the original request that may be used in case of an URL failure during the tunnelling process.

this data is irreversibly purged from server’s RAM after 90 seconds.
no one has access to cached tunnel data, even instance owners,
as long as cobalt’s source code is not modified.

media data from tunnels is never stored/cached anywhere.
everything is processed live, even during remuxing and transcoding.
cobalt tunnels function like an anonymous proxy.

if your device supports local processing,
then encrypted tunnel info includes way less info, because it’s returned to client instead.

see the [related source code on github](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/tree/main/api/src/stream) to learn more about how it works.

### encryption

temporarily stored tunnel data is encrypted using the AES-256 standard.
decryption keys are only included in the access link and never logged/cached/stored anywhere.
only the end user has access to the link & encryption keys.
keys are generated uniquely for each requested tunnel.

### anonymous traffic analytics

we use [plausible](https://plausible.io/) to get an approximate number
of active cobalt users, fully anonymously. no identifiable information about
you or your requests is ever stored. all data is anonymized and aggregated.
we self-host and manage the [plausible instance](https://a.imput.net/) that cobalt uses.

plausible doesn’t use cookies and is fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and PECR.

if you wish to opt out of anonymous analytics, you can do it in [privacy settings](https://cobalt.tools/settings/privacy#analytics).
if you opt out, the plausible script will not be loaded at all.

[learn more about plausible’s dedication to privacy](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

### web privacy & security

we use cloudflare services for:

- ddos & abuse protection.
- bot protection (cloudflare turnstile).
- hosting & deploying the statically rendered web app (cloudflare workers).

all of these are required to provide the best experience for everyone.
cloudflare is the most private & reliable provider for all mentioned solutions that we know of.

cloudflare is fully compliant with GDPR and HIPAA.

## about

### general terms

these terms are applicable only when using the official cobalt instance.
in other cases, you may need to contact the instance hoster for accurate info.

### saving

saving functionality simplifies downloading content from the internet
and we take zero liability for what the saved content is used for.

processing servers operate like advanced proxies and don’t ever write any requested content to disk.
everything is handled in RAM and permanently purged once the tunnel is completed.
we have no downloading logs and cannot identify anyone.

you can learn more about how tunnels work in [privacy policy](https://cobalt.tools/about/privacy).

### user responsibilities

you (end user) are responsible for what you do with our tools, how you use and distribute resulting content.
please be mindful when using content of others and always credit original creators.
make sure you don’t violate any terms or licenses.

when used in educational purposes, always cite sources and credit original creators.

fair use and credits benefit everyone.

### reporting abuse

we have no way of detecting abusive behavior automatically because cobalt is fully anonymous.
however, you can report such activities to us via email and we’ll do our best to comply manually: abuse\[at\]imput.net

**this email is not intended for user support, you will not get a response if your concern is not related to abuse.**

if you’re experiencing issues, you can reach out for support via any preferred method on [the community page](https://cobalt.tools/about/community).

### partners

a portion of cobalt’s processing infrastructure
is provided by our long-standing partner, [royalehosting.net](https://royalehosting.net/?partner=cobalt)!

### meowbalt

meowbalt is cobalt’s speedy mascot, a very expressive cat who loves fast internet.

all amazing art of meowbalt that you see in cobalt
was made by [GlitchyPSI](https://glitchypsi.xyz/).
he’s also the original creator of the character.

imput holds legal rights to meowbalt’s character design,
but not specific artworks that were created by GlitchyPSI.

we love meowbalt, so we have to set a few rules in place to protect him:

- you cannot use meowbalt’s character design in any form that isn’t fan art.
- you cannot use meowbalt’s design or artworks commercially.
- you cannot use meowbalt’s design or artworks in your own projects.
- you cannot use or modify GlitchyPSI’s artworks of meowbalt in any form.

if you create fan art of meowbalt, please share it in [our discord server](https://cobalt.tools/about/community), we’d love to see it!

### licenses

cobalt api (processing server) code is open source and licensed under [AGPL-3.0](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/main/api/LICENSE).

cobalt frontend code is [source first](https://sourcefirst.com/) and is licensed under [CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt/blob/main/web/LICENSE).

we had to make frontend source first to stop grifters from profiting off our work
& from creating malicious clones that deceive people and hurt our public identity.
other than commercial use, it follows same principles as many open source licenses.

we rely on many open source libraries, but also create & distribute our own.
you can see the full list of dependencies on [github](https://github.com/imputnet/cobalt)!

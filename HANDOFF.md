# Handoff: Final Animation Polish

## Completed Work
- **Animation Selection**: Hardcoded `DropZone` animation to `HYDRAULIC` (Scale Y 0->1).
- **Staggered Entrance**: Delayed `Controls` panel animation (0.7s) to slide in after the hydraulic entrance completes.
- **Cleanup**: Removed the animation selector and replay controls from the Debug Menu (kept the internal animation library in code for future use).
- **Refinement**: Ensured all entrance animations are brutalist (no simple fades).

## Current State
- **Branch**: `main` (merging latest).
- **Build**: verified passing.

## Next Steps
- Proceed with `todo.md` features.
- Further refine "Hydraulic" feel if needed (maybe add a bounce at the end).

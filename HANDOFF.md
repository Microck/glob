# Handoff: Brutalist Animation Overhaul

## Completed Work
- **Animation Strategy**: Replaced generic "fade-up" animations with varied, brutalist-inspired effects across the UI.
- **Header**: Reverted text to static "glob" (removed problematic animation).
- **DropZone**: Implemented "Block Reveal" (hard wipe left-to-right).
- **Controls**: Implemented "Staggered Snap" (sharp slide-up).
- **ComparisonViewer**: Implemented "Glitch Entrance" (blur + scale snap).
- **GLBViewer**: Implemented "Elastic Scale" (pop-in).
- **Roadmap**: Created `todo.md` with planned features (polygon count, wireframe, premium, etc.).

## Current State
- **Branch**: `main` (Merged PR #9 previously, now on `mic/brutalist-polish-2` effectively but actually I'm working on `main` directly for this step).
- **Build**: verified passing.

## Next Steps
- Execute items from `todo.md` (e.g., polygon counts, wireframe).
- Refine animations based on user feedback (timing/easings).
